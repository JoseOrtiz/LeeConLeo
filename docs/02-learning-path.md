# 2. Learning path

## Stages

```
Stage 0  Spatial concepts        up/down, left/right, over/under, between, in/out
Stage 1  Listening               syllable clapping, rhymes, "same first sound?"  (no letters yet)
Stage 2  Vowels                  a  e  i  o  u   (single vowels — new in 2.0)
Stage 3  Vowel combinations      ai au ei eu oi ... ("ay", "oye", "au")  (the 2014 starting point)
Stage 4  Direct syllables        consonant + vowel: ma me mi mo mu, pa pe ...  (Silabario order)
Stage 5  Inverse syllables       am em im om um, al el ..., as es ...
Stage 6  Special graphemes       ch, ll, rr, ñ, qu (que/qui), gue/gui, güe/güi, soft c (ce/ci), soft g (ge/gi), silent h
Stage 7  Blends ("trabadas")     bl br cl cr dr fl fr gl gr pl pr tr
Stage 8  Words and sentences     read a word → match it to a picture → read a short sentence
```

Stage 1 runs **alongside** stages 2–4 as review and warm-up games. It isn't a gate
the child has to pass first.

### Why single vowels first

In 2014 the map started at "ao". A child who doesn't know "a" or "o" on their own
gets two unknowns at once. The Silabario itself starts from single vowels, and they
are also the pieces of every syllable after that.

## Consonant order

Start from the 2014 order, which teachers chose because children know these
letters best:

```
m p l d s b c(ca co cu) f g(ga go gu) h j k n r t v w x y z
```

Proposed changes, **to be validated with teachers**:

| Change | Reason |
|---|---|
| Move **t** and **n** right after s | Very common in first words (*tomate, nene, mono*), and their sounds are clear |
| Move **k, w, x** to the end | Rare in children's vocabulary, and many of their syllables had no pictures in 2014 |
| Split **c** and **g** by sound | *ca co cu* belongs in stage 4. *ce ci* (sounds like /s/) and *ge gi* (sounds like /x/, "j") go to stage 6 |
| **h** in stage 6, taught as "the silent letter" | *ha* sounds like *a*. Treating it as a regular consonant confuses children |
| **r:** teach the soft *r* inside words (*pera*); the strong *r* at the start of words (*ratón*) and *rr* come later | These are two different sounds written with the same letter |
| Add **ñ, ch, ll** | Missing in 2014, and very common in Chilean words (*niño, chancho, llave*) |

The order lives in a content file (`path.yaml`, see
[05](05-content-and-assets.md)), so a teacher or a fork can reorder it without
touching code.

## How sounds are modelled

Every syllable and word carries a **sound key** for Chilean Spanish. Activities
compare sound keys, not spellings.

| Written | Sound key | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| ce, ci / se, si / ze, zi | `se`, `si` | Seseo: *cielo* and *silla* **both** start with the /si/ sound |
| ge, gi / je, ji | `je`, `ji` | *gente* and *jefe* share a starting sound |
| ha, he ... | `a`, `e` ... | *helado* starts with the /e/ sound |
| ba / va | `ba` | *vaca* and *barco* share a starting sound |
| ya / lla | `ya` | Yeísmo: *llave* and *yate* share a starting sound |
| que, qui / ke, ki | `ke`, `ki` | |

Rules that follow from this:

- **Correct answers:** "Starts with the /si/ sound" accepts *silla* and *cielo*.
  "Starts with the letters *si*" accepts only *silla*. Early stages use the
  *sound* version, and stage 6 uses the *spelling* version to teach the difference.
- **Distractors:** a wrong option must never share the sound key being tested. This
  prevents unfair questions (in 2014, *mani* could appear as a distractor for "mi").

## Mastery and review

- A step is **mastered** at ≥ 80 % correct over the last 10 tries, with at least 2
  sessions.
- A mastered step unlocks the next one. The child can always replay earlier steps.
- **Spaced review:** each session starts with 2–3 quick items from mastered steps,
  weighted towards the ones answered wrong most recently.
- When a child fails the same step repeatedly (3 sessions below 50 %), the app
  suggests an easier related activity and flags the step in the teacher view. It
  does not lock the child out.
