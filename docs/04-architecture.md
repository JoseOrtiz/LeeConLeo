# 4. Architecture

## Stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Flutter** (stable channel) | One codebase for Android + iOS, with web possible later. Smooth touch and custom drawing |
| Game-like activities | **Flame** | Runner, drag scenes, particle feedback. Embedded as widgets inside normal Flutter screens |
| State | **Riverpod** | Testable, no global singletons |
| Navigation | **go_router** | Map → unit → activity, with deep links for testing |
| Local storage | **drift** (SQLite) | Profiles, progress and the event log. Queryable for the teacher view and CSV export |
| Audio | **just_audio** (speech), **flame_audio** (effects) | Short clips, low latency, preloading per activity |
| Localization | Flutter `intl` / ARB | Adult-facing UI only (settings, teacher view). Child-facing prompts are audio |

Package choices get re-checked for maintenance status when the project starts.

## Platforms and layout

- **Android and iOS** from milestone 1. **Web** once the core is stable (useful for
  demos and Chromebooks).
- **Phones and tablets, portrait and landscape.** Layouts are built on a "play
  area", a square-ish region scaled to the screen, plus side or bottom rails for
  the controls. No hardcoded pixel offsets (the 2014 code had values like `-252`
  and `-64`).
- **Touch targets at least 64 dp** for children (above the usual 48 dp minimum).
- Minimum supported versions follow Flutter's defaults. The Android target SDK
  follows Google Play's current requirement.

## Project structure

```
lib/
  app/              routing, theme, app shell, shared widgets
  core/
    audio/          prompt player, preload, "listen again"
    content/        content models + loader (reads the generated JSON bundle)
    progress/       mastery rules, spaced review, unlock logic
    logging/        event log, observation mode, CSV export
    profiles/       child profiles, parental gate
  activities/
    common/         activity frame: intro → items → feedback → reward
    spatial/        up_down, left_right, positions, follow_path
    listening/      clap_syllables, rhymes, same_sound, blend
    letter/         meet, trace, find
    syllables/      starts_with, ends_with, build_word, circle_it
    reading/        read_and_match, leo_reads
    runner/         Flame game
  map/              world map, sticker album
  utils/            pure helpers (Spanish syllables, sound keys)
content/            source YAML (see 05) — edited by humans
tool/               content build + validation (Dart CLI)
assets/             generated bundle, images, audio, fonts
test/               unit, widget, golden tests
```

### The activity contract

Every activity is built on the same pieces. That keeps the common frame
consistent and makes new activities cheap to add:

```dart
abstract interface class ActivitySpec {
  String get id;
  List<ActivityItem> buildItems(ActivityContext context);
  Widget buildItemView(ActivityItem item, ItemController controller);
}
```

- `ActivityContext` gives the activity the content bundle, the current step and a
  `Random`.
- `ItemController` is the only thing an item view talks to: `answer(value)` and
  `isHintActive`.
- `ActivitySession` runs the shared frame (intro, items, feedback, hints, reward,
  logging), so a new activity only builds its items and its view.
- Intro prompts follow the convention `<activityId>.intro` in `prompts.yaml`.

`buildItems` **generates** rounds from the word bank, using sound keys and
distractor rules. The 2014 approach of hand-writing one text file per syllable
and activity (about 430 files) goes away.

## Observation mode and data

- **Always on (local only):** the event log that feeds mastery and review.
- **Observation mode (opt-in, behind the parental gate):** adds session markers
  and an observer note field, and **exports CSV** through the system share sheet.
- **Event row:** `timestamp, profileNick, sessionId, stage, step, activity, itemId,
  target, answer, correct, responseMs, hintUsed, attempts`.
- **Teacher view:** per profile, mastered steps, accuracy per step, the most common
  confusions (for example *b ↔ d*), and time played.
- **Privacy:** no network calls, no analytics SDKs, no advertising IDs. Profile =
  nickname + avatar. Designed to meet the Google Play Families policy and the Apple
  Kids category, and to be easy to explain to schools under Chilean data-protection
  law. Get a legal review of the privacy text before publishing.

## Quality

- **Content validation** (`dart run tool/content.dart validate`) fails the build
  when something is missing or wrong:
  - every phrase has its recorded clip, and every word has a picture, audio, a syllable split and
    a sound key
  - every asset appears in `CREDITS`
  - no generated round has fewer than 4 valid options
- **Tests:**
  - unit tests for mastery, distractor generation and sound keys
  - widget tests for the activity frame
  - golden tests for phone and tablet layouts
- **CI (GitHub Actions):** analyze, test, content validation, then build an Android
  APK and an iOS build (no signing) on every PR.
- **Releases:** GitHub Releases (APK), Google Play, App Store. F-Droid is worth
  considering because the app has no proprietary dependencies.
